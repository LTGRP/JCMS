A very simple mysql-based web content management system we did back in the day
for the Tomcat server in Java. Supports pages, and templated blocks within pages. 
This was commercially used by some pretty high-profile corporate sites for a while. 
Now I'm putting this here as an open source download with a BSD license, to whom
it might concern. :-)

If you have trouble getting it to run, please drop me a message.
